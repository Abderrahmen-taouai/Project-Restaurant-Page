# Project-Restaurant-Page

THE ODIN PROJECT: Project: Restaurant Page

Practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a restaurant homepage! We are going to be using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website!

Note: DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but styling can be done in a separate CSS file.

I make it simple because. I learned how to use Webpack, how manage assets and bundle. In addition using JS Module was great to have reusable and maintainable product.
