THE ODIN PROJECT: Project: Restaurant Page

Practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a restaurant homepage!  We are going to be using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website!

Note: DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but styling can be done in a separate CSS file.
